&lt;p&gt;Look, I’ll be honest:&lt;br&gt;
I made this page because every website has an About page,&lt;br&gt;
and I didn’t want mine to feel left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day it’ll say something profound.&lt;br&gt;
Today it’s basically waving awkwardly from across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you actually want to contact me (which… wow),&lt;br&gt;
email &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:info@newfolder22.co.uk"&gt;info@newfolder22.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
